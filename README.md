# survey-form
A survey form I created in HTML and CSS that could be used for my brother with his fundraising for Kenya

He was fundraising with the hope of travelling to Kenya with ‘African Adventures’ in July 2021 as part of his high school to educate children out there and improve their infrastructure

To raise money, we came up with the idea to set up a baking business – ‘Kenya Bakes’, selling ‘pizookies’ (pizza-sized cookies) each with customisable designs, raising over £2000

In the end the trip was cancelled due to COVID-19 but the plan is still set to go out in the next year or two
